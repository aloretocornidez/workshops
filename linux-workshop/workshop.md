# Linux Workshop

Author: Alan Manuel Loreto Cornídez

Purpose: Linux is a powerful tool that can be used to change and optimize your
workflow to better fit your needs, what can you do to get started?

## What Is Linux?

> I’d just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is

> Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free
> component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs,
> shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by
> POSIX.

> Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day,

> not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

While the meme clearly exists for a reason, let me ask you, "Would you trust a
mechanic who doesn't know when they should use their ratchet, impact gun, or
hammer?"

In short, linux is the word that people use to refer a a lot of things that are
technically more than just linux. In order to better communicate what we're
actually doing, I'm going to define some terms. Having an understanding of the
intricacies of these differences will allow us to better communicate with each
other as well as better understand our tools.

**Linux**: The Linux kernel (or the windows kernel) is the interface between the
computer hardware and the processes running on the computer. The kernel is the
part of the operating system that properly allocates hardware resources to run
software.

**Shell**: The shell is the human interface with the operating system's. By
using a shell we are able to write human readable commands that let us tell the
operating system to run software.

**Command Line**: The command line is an interface used to execute shell
commands. Commands can be executed using a graphical user interface (GUI) or
through the command line (using a terminal emulator).

**GNU Core Utils**: The GNU(pronounced guh-new) core utils is a collection of
software tools that allow us to useful commands through the command line. If you
want to 'level up' your 'linux' prowess, it would be wise to lean how to utilize
these tools. A list of many useful commands in addition to a brief description
can be found at
[wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GNU_Core_Utilities_commands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_GNU_Core_Utilities_commands).

## Why should I use linux?

Linux isn't for everyone, it's not the perfect platform for every application,
however, Linux excels at what it is good at.

Here's a few reasons for why I use linux:

- Software Development

  - Python
  - C/C++
  - Git
  - Web Development
  - Embedded Systems

- Linux offers endless customizability
- Privacy is much easier to maintain on linux.
- Free-Open Source software

Who is linux not for?

Linux does not work well for people who are bound to certain pieces of software.
There are lots of software tools that are only available on linux (with full
compatibility).

- Adobe Design Suite
- Gaming (Though, this situation is much better than before).


## How Can I get Started?

There are multiple options for getting started with linux:

Process Virtual Machines (A computer in your computer)  

- Oracle Virtual Box 
- VM Ware 



- System Virtual Machines 
    -
