# CMake Workshop

Author: Alan Manuel Loreto Corn√≠dez

Purpose: Workshop documentation for CMake. Presented at the IEEE technical
workshop meeting.

## What Is CMake?

tl;dr: CMake is a powerful software cross platform build system. It allows you
compile C++ code across multiple computers that may use different compilation
tools. You write one file that many developers can use and CMake.

## Let's talk about how making software.

When creating software there are many things that we have to consider. In this
case, let's assume we've chosen to work in C++.

What do we need to build software in C++?

- Source Code Files
- Libraries
- Compilers

Let's go ahead and start with a simple program in C++:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

  // Print out hello world.
  std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

> How would we run this code?

First we need to compile the code. This is done using my C++ compiler, g++.

Let's compile my program:

```bash
g++ -o myProgramGpp code/main.cpp
```

Then let's go ahead and run my program by calling `./myprogram`.

You'll see the following output: 

```
Hello World!
```


What if I want to build this program using another compiler?

Let's use clang: 

```bash 
clang++ -o myprogramClang code/main.cpp
```


As you can see, we can use two different compilers to compile our code. 


What if I need to include a library?
