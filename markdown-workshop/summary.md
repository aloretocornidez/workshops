# Summary

When you use a markdown processor, you can put all of the knowledge that you learn about markdown, $\LaTeX$, and use it to optimize your workflow to how you want to use it.

You can use markdown to:
- Write websites (Resume conversion demo.)
- Write Your Notes (My School Notes)
- Meeting Notes (That can link to other notes)
- Do School Assignments (Show my homework 541 ex.)

The possibilities are only limited by your creativity.
