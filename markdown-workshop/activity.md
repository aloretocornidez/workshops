# Markdown Workshop Activity

## Objective
Create a `README.md` for your github profile!

> You can share information about yourself with the community on GitHub.com by creating a profile README. 
> GitHub shows your profile README at the top of your profile page.
> You decide what information to include in your profile README, so you have full control over how you present yourself on GitHub.
> Here are some examples of information that visitors may find interesting, fun, or useful in your profile README.

> - An "About me" section that describes your work and interests
> - Contributions you're proud of, and context about those contributions
> - Guidance for getting help in communities where you're involved
> Source: [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)

## Example Profile Readme

Here's my [README.md](https://github.com/aloretocornidez/aloretocornidez/blob/main/README.md?plain=1) for my [profile](https://github.com/aloretocornidez). 

Feel free to 'reference' (steal) as much as you'd like! (It's open source after all :shrug:)






After you finish working on your GitHub `README.md` you can continue to read about $\LaTeX$ [here](./LaTeX.md).
