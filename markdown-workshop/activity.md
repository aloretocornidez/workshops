# Markdown Workshop Activity

This is an activity that involves the use of markdown to create a personal
GitHub readme page.

## Objective

Create a `README.md` for your GitHub profile!

> You can share information about yourself with the community on GitHub.com by
> creating a profile README. GitHub shows your profile README at the top of your
> profile page. You decide what information to include in your profile README,
> so you have full control over how you present yourself on GitHub. Here are
> some examples of information that visitors may find interesting, fun, or
> useful in your profile README.

> - An "About me" section that describes your work and interests
> - Contributions you're proud of, and context about those contributions
> - Guidance for getting help in communities where you're involved Source:
>   [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)

## Procedure

1. [Create a GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup)
2. [Create a Profile GitHub Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)
3. Place a `README.md` file in the `root` directory of the repository.
4. Modify your `README.md` file and add the things!

## Example Profile readme

Here's my
[README.md](https://github.com/aloretocornidez/aloretocornidez/blob/main/README.md?plain=1)
for my [profile](https://github.com/aloretocornidez).

Feel free to 'reference' (steal) as much as you'd like!

After you finish working on your GitHub `README.md` you can continue to read
about $\LaTeX$ [here](./LaTeX.md).
