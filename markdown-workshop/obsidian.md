# Obsidian

## What is Obsidian?

In short, obsidian is a markdown processor, with multiple other features that make the use of markdown more powerful.

I use it to take notes in school.

- Organize my notes 
	- Topics 
	- Lectures
	- Tags
- Include screenshots in my notes
- Include equations in my notes
- Include tables
- My notes can be synced via GitHub.



Let's do a little [workshop activity](./activity.md) now that we know a little bit more about markdown.
